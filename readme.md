TODO
I wanted to have full dev env inside of a container,
so I don't need to polute my local machine, e.g. node for webdev plugins, rust for rust dev tools, but
when I use tmux, setup an ssh session with a dev container and I run nvim in the session, the tmux server crashes

create a list of deps:
node
rustup
